                    The first thing that drew my attention to this VR experience was the act that it was an experience
                    that surrounded Mickey Mouse. However, within the experience itself you are first presented with the
                    outside of the exhibition, as if you were actually in NYC, waiting to enter into the experience. One
                    thing that I really liked was that each Coach Item that was being displayed was one where you are
                    able to click onto it, bringing up a closer view. Since this is more of a ad for Coach to try to
                    sell their new collection, it is more focused on selling. However, I really liked how they
                    transformed the experience of shopping online into an entire interactive exhibition experience.

                </p>

                <p>
                    I really also found the moving 3D images of Keith Haring’s Mickeys really stand out. Not only do the
                    moving images stand out from the static ness of the experience, but the images move as if they are
                    looking around the room with you and waving hello to the user, encapsulating Mickey’s personality of
                    curiosity and friendliness. The last part that REALLY caught my attention was a room constructed as
                    if it were one of the subway stations in NYC. There is a Gift Shop sign that imitates a NYC subway
                    sign to get you to this room, as if you are really going down to the subway. When you get to the
                    room, you can hear sounds of the subway as if a train was really arriving and the announcer’s voice.
                    The room at first is blank white, until you click onto a pencil button, completely transforming the
                    room by covering the walls and subway cars with Disney Keith Haring artworks. The user is then able
                    to change the different artworks on any surface of the “station” allowing a sense of control over
                    the exhibit.

                    Nasa collaborate with Google in-order to develop this VR experience to show people the landing of
                    the Curiosity Rover and where it went to take photos on the surface of mars. What I really enjoyed
                    about this VR experience was the beginning where you are presented with text about the landing and
                    you can hear the countdown from NASA’s control room. This really brings the user into the mindset of
                    them embarking on the journey to mars rather than just seeing the surface of mars.

                </p>

                <p>
                    When you get to the surface of mars, I really enjoyed the icons that pop up from the surface to
                    allow the user to click onto. It gives information about the place in which the Curiosity Rover
                    landed, as well as the specific photographs that it took. You get to not only see the surface, but
                    learn more about the rocks on the surface and the rover itself. Another aspect that I really enjoyed
                    was the “Map” feature which mapped out the journey in which the Curiosity Rover drove down where you
                    can follow and venture to, allowing the usr to learn more about the specific areas of mars and its
                    scientific values.

                    One of the most interesting aspects of this VR experience was the ability for it to replicate one of
                    the locations that the show She-Ra takes place in. It replicates both he hologram like figure (First
                    One’s Vigil) as if she is speaking to you, but also presents the characters as their own holograms.
                    I really like how this was formulated entirely through animation.

                </p>

                <p>
                    Another aspect that I really enjoyed from this was the ability to click onto each of the holograms,
                    which would then zoom in closer and accompanied with a small explanation of the character as if the
                    First One’s Vigil was speaking to you about them. The ability to have the hologram speak to you and
                    explain the characters is so much more engaging than if you were to read it on your won without any
                    type of zoom or concentration not he character that you had chosen.
