                <p>
                    I would like to have an hover effect when the user hovers over a specific part of the water. When
                    they hover over the icon, the user will be presented with a infographic about the fishing Industry
                    in Miami Florida where this picture takes place. In conjunction to that, If the user were to hover
                    over the Tuna Fishing Boat, I would like for there to be a video that can play one the user clicks
                    onto the video to play. The video would be able to show them how the Tuna Fishing Industry is like
                    right now or has been currently and the ways that the world is fighting against the extinction and
                    conservation for Blue Fin Tuna.

                    For the Ferris wheel, to add a fun element, I think that it would be great to have the sounds of an
                    amusement park. Or the music that would occur at the carnival, also allowing a history behind the
                    Ferris wheel and Carnival.

                        <li>‎The glows of the other stations in the distance </li>

                    <p>
                        For the LA Silla observatory image, I would really like for there to be a fun, gamification
                        element to this VR experience. If the user were to hover over the stars, depending on where
                        their Mouse hovers over, there will be a twinkling sound, as well as the star that was hovered
                        over to enlarge to see what the user has hovered over on. However, to increase the User’s
                        Experience, the sounds will be defaulted to be turned off just in case they are in an
                        environment where they are unable to play sounds aloud. There would be a sound icon that would
                        be seen as off on the corner of the screen that the user would be able to toggle back and forth.

                    </p>

                    <p>
                        There would also be a info icon near the observatory that would allow a modal to pop up to
                        provide more information to the user about the observatory itself. If the user was interested in
                        farthing their knowledge about he entire observatory itself, they would be able to click onto a
                        link to the observatory’s website to learn even more.

                <h2>Fort Point. San Fransisco</h2>

                <h4>The Objects</h4>
                <ol>
                    <li>The Cannons </li>
                    <li>‎‎‎Hallways of cannons </li>
                    <li>Railings with Flags </li>
                </ol>

                <p>
                    For Fort Point I would have a series of Links and modals that would open up within the page that
                    would allow the user to learn more information about the Historic National Site. The first thing I
                    would do is to link audio to the Cannon that is facing the user in the image. There will be a
                    library of sounds that the user would be able play. Instead of playing automatically, the user will
                    be presented with a modal that allows them to choose what sounds they would want to hear that
                    relates to the historic site whether they are cannon sounds or a small story about the site.

                </p>

                <p>
                    In the hallway, I think having a modal that gives a preview of the national park site for Fort Point
                    would be a great way to learn more about the National Site. The modal will be a preview, but there
                    will be link that the user can click onto in order to go to the site itself to learn more.

                    The area with the Flags, I think that if the user were to hover over it, there can be images of the
                    older versions of the site that the National Park’s website has. When hovering over, you can click
                    through a carousel of images that allows the user to see the years in which the site has looked
                    like.
